    Distributed Computing
    NFS - Network File System - > distribute single HDD with different systems
    Protocols work for storage :
        ISCSI
        CEPH
        GFS
    Device Mapping - > Different Hard Disk combines together in single OS that is create a virtual hard disk by combining all different HDD virtually
    Device Mapping is also referred as DM or device mapper
    By default amazon doesn't understand DM tech
    Not always command name is the name of software
    every cloud has customized his shell as per his services
    Volume Group - > combination of different HDD into a virtual HDD
    PE Size = Physical Extend Size of a virtual hard disk - > it is similar to sector
    By default PE Size (minimum parition size) is 4 MB
    PE Size can be changed or customized
    All hard disks are always stored in /device
    troubleshoot4opensource - study about LVM
    LVM need to be practiced a lot
    Size of FB website code is 1.2 mb (approximately)
    LXC is Linux Container
    World's Smallest micro service is of size 1.84 kb
    GCE - > Google Cloud Engine && GCP - > Google Cloud Platform
    CPU(Central Processing Unit) - > GPU(Graphical Processing Unit) -> TPU (Tensorflow Processing Unit) : All 3 can be used anytime for almost 12 hours continuously
    Ip + port = Socket which is registered with some protocol

DM

it is of 2 types : * LVM (works on RHEL7) -> Logical Volume Management * Stratis (works on RHEL 8)
LVM

    fdisk -l # to check your attached volume are attached properly
    Create virtual HDD by
    creating a physical volume by run the Command

$ pvcreate disk-name-1 disk-name-2

    run Command - provides a name to virtual group

$ vgcreate virtual-hard-disk-name

    to display the created hdd , run Command

$ vgdisplay virtual-hdd-name

    finally create a LVM

$ lvcreate virt-hdd-name

    to check final virtual group status run

$ lvdisplay

    now you can create partition and use HDD

Open AWS without .pek File

    open /etc/ssh/ssh_config
    change PasswordAuthentication to yes from no

Linux Commands :

    $ pvcreate disk-name-1 disk-name-2 # creates a physical volume
    $ pvcreate /dev/xvd{h,g} # createa a physical volume
    $ yum whatprovides * /command # gives software name of command to be installed
    $ vgcreate virtual-hard-disk-name # creates a virtual hard disk fom two different physical HDD
    $ vgdisplay virtual-hdd-name # shows the status of virtual hard disk
    $ lvcreate virtual-HDD-name
    $ editor-name +line-number file-name # opens the editor at the exact line
    $ netstat -nulp # which udp ports are being used over our OS
    $ netstat -ntlp # which tcp ports are being used

Micro Services

    Running only a single service over an OS
    Its like running only IDLE in an OS and there is nothing present in it other then IDLE(e.g, My computer, Explorer are not in OS)
    Micro Operating System uses Linux
    A services is provided with all RAM and CPU that it requires
    PODMAN - > technology used in RHEL 8 to develop OS with single micro services
    BUILDAH is a backend service provider for PODMAN
    In redhat 7.5 and ubuntu developing micro service is done by docker

Installing docker

    add url in yum.repos.d
    summer19/kubernetes
    run commmand

$ yum install docker -y

Python Data Streaming
Topics

* Module
* File Handling
* Input
* Print
* IP : A:B:C:D (where A,B,C,D have values b/w 0 - 255)
* Port : Port No is the number of application with which a data is supposed to contact with
  * It is of 2 byte ( 0 to 65535)
* TCP : Transmission Control Protocol, Reliable, Realtime
  #### Examples of TCP
    * http
    * https

* UDP : User Datagram Protocol , Unreliable
  #### Examples of UDP
  * youtube buffering is an example of UDP
  * live video streaming , DNS Video Streaming , DHCP
  * we can not send video

Types of Cast

1. Broadcast - > one sender to all receiver
2. Unicast - > one to one
3. Multicast - > one sender and many receiver but not all

Unicast

    Connect with yourself
    Connect with one other systems

Creating a UDP

* sender and receiver must have same protocol tcp or udp
* create 2 python files one for receiver and one for sender
* in receiver file,use socket module and write code
```
# i will write later
```
* in sender file, re write code again
```
# i will write later
```
* run sender and receiver file both on different terminals

## Facts

    Smallest LXC ever created is 1.84KB which gives result of Hello World.
    RHEL8 introduces Podman (Platform product) and Buildah (Backend Support).
    In RHEL7.5 or Ubuntu it is called Docker.
    Port number is used to specify to which program the connection have to communicate.
    Port Range starting from 0-65535.
    SSH port no 22
    http port no 80
    Port number is of 2 bytes.
    https port no 443
    UDP is the most used protocol over internet.
    Main examples of UDP are DNS, Video Streaming, DHCP
    http and https works on TCP
    Broadcast means Single sender all reciever.
    Unicast meanle Single sender single reciever
    Multicast means single sender multiple reciever but not all.

LVM (Logical Volume Management)

    It is used to connect multiple hard disks and manage volumes.
    Step 1 Connect multiple physical disks
    Step 2 Use LVM to create a volume group
    Step 3 Then create Logical volumes or partitions as per the requirement.
    pvcreate is a command used to create physical storages.
    Since pvcreate is not a by default installed package therefore we need to install it using yum.
    To find package name of a command use the command

yum whatprovides */pvcreate

Creating Volume Group and Partition

    We use pvcreate to create physical storage

pvcreate /dev/xvdg /dev/xvdf
pvcreate /dev/xvd{g,f}

[root@ip-172-31-9-238 ~]# pvcreate /dev/xvd{f,g}
  Physical volume "/dev/xvdf" successfully created.
  Physical volume "/dev/xvdg" successfully created.

    Now we are creating virtual group using the command vgcreate and give a group name with that.

[root@ip-172-31-9-238 ~]# vgcreate myvirdd /dev/xvd{f,g}
  Volume group "myvirdd" successfully created

    To display the status of virtual group use command vgdisplay

[root@ip-172-31-9-238 ~]# vgdisplay myvirdd
  --- Volume group ---
  VG Name               myvirdd
  System ID
  Format                lvm2
  Metadata Areas        2
  Metadata Sequence No  1
  VG Access             read/write
  VG Status             resizable
  MAX LV                0
  Cur LV                0
  Open LV               0
  Max PV                0
  Cur PV                2
  Act PV                2
  VG Size               3.99 GiB
  PE Size               4.00 MiB
  Total PE              1022
  Alloc PE / Size       0 / 0
  Free  PE / Size       1022 / 3.99 GiB
  VG UUID               iNRVcL-Wez9-xYY2-QuZN-OXuf-VGvi-IEQvc9

    Physical Extent (PE Size) is similar to sectors in Hard Disk. It is by default in 4MB Multiple.
    PE is also the minimum size of the virtual hard disk. We can configure that according to our requirements.
    Now we need to create logical volume so there is a command called lvcreate

lvcreate --name part1 --size 400M myvirdd

    Now we need to mount the partition you can check the path of the partition using lvdisplay
    Now mount it mount /dev/mapper/myvirdd-part1 /mnt/part1

Configure SSHD to provide access remotely.

    Create a user account in your AWS names adhoc and use the password 123spacespace.
    Edit the line no 65 of /etc/ssh/sshd_config
    Turn it to Yes
    Then restart the service systemctl restart sshd
    Now you can connect via ```ssh username@ipaddress

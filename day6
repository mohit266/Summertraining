DAY 6
Notes

    if permissions are not given to a user for a file the user can copy the file to another path and he will have all permissions to play with it
    sticky-bit is default applied in tmp directory
    dev directory is devices
    etc is extended configuration
    hard-disk should be purchased from same active region of service
    hard - disk is purchased from EBS under Volume
    Mailinator is a website where free email id is provided without credentials.
    to make multiple directory at single time

mkdir -p A/B/D/H A/C/F A/B/E

    By default mkdir make directory with permission 777 - umask(002)
    By default text-files are given permission 662
    + indicates ACL is being applied at some file
    when we check ACL permissions on a file it shows a type mask which indicates      highest permission on file In chmod we have a octal number system also there.
     Read - 4 Write - 2 execute - 1 remove - 0

754 4+2+1 = 7 read write execute 4+1 = 5 read execute 4 = 4 read

Sticky bit - 1 SGID - 2 2+1 =3 SGID and STicky bit 1 sticky 2 sgid

chmod 3777 /folder

Set File Access Control List -m stands for modify setfacl -m u:u4:rx /check u stands for user g stands for group

Get File Access Control List getfacl /check This is used to check the permissions

To remove facl we use setfacl -x u:u4 /check

umask is a factor in permissions which gives permission to every new file or directory.

To remove permission from firefox from user 4 setfacl -m u:u4:--- /usr/bin/firefox
LINUX Redhat

    lsblk # shows partitions and hard disks in red Redhat
    fdisk -l # shows partitions in present hard-disk
    $ setfacl -b file.ext # Remove all ACL permissions
    $ setfacl -x u:user-name file.ext # Remove single user ACL
    $ yum provides package-name # it tells us which repo provides the specific package
    $ yum reinstall package-name #reinstalls the specified package

Architecture (TASK)

    Make two groups
    in group 1 add 3 users
    in group 2 add 5 users
    create folders A to M as in pic
    in K directory only permissions will be given to group 2
    in L directory the permissions will be given to group 1
    top 3 levels of architecture should not be touched by any of the groups
    use stickybit and gsid
    make the architecture using mkdir only once

File System Security

    read = 4
    write = 2
    execute = 1
    sticky bit = 1
    SGID = 2
    None = -
    example

    $ chmod 421 file.ext
    # 421 == owner group other

    all permission = 7
    remove all permission = 000
    add all permission = 777
    read + execute = 4 + 1 = 5

 chmod  u     own     g     oth     
      special owner group   other

example $chmod 2777 /check # add SGID
User architecture

    root - all permissions
    group - name = Tech - has 2 users - all permission
    other - has many users - no permissions
    provide rx permission to single user in other * it can be done using ACL

Access control list

    extended permission to be given to different users and permissions will be different
    setfacl - > set file access control list
    -m - > modify , user:user-name:permission

$ setfacl -m u:u4:rx file.extension
$ getfacl file.extension

    to check ACL permission given to which user use getfacl

    to remove ACL permission from a users

     $ setfacl -x u:u4 file.extension

Linux permissions is an important topic find out all questions related to it over google

    UMASK - > changing permissions which comes by default

Storage Management

    As per Student , storage is of 2 types ~ :
        Primary - > RAM
        Secondary - > HDD
    By 2025 DNA will replace hard-disk to store data ( Project human as a storage device , 2kg DNA)
    Why partitions are necessary : partitions are necessary to use same hard disk for multiple OS installations

Secondary Storage

There are two types of partition table

    MBR (Master Boot Record)
    GPT (Guided Partition Table)

Partition table is a memory or a storage which remembers no of partitions size and other info.
Partition table

* No of partitions that are possible to br created in a storage depends on partition table.
* It is of 2 types ~ :
  1. MBR
  2. GPT
* in a hard disk , how many partitions can be made beyond hard disk size
* MBR (Master Boot Record) - > minimum 4 partitions are possible approximately
* GPT - > around 10 partitions are possible approximately
* partition table is made inside the hard - disk itself
* MBR does not work over 2 TB data hard-disk
* GPT has no limit or around ( 8 ETB)
* By default GPT partition table is used Windows nowadays

MBR

* 64 byte size for partition information
* Parttions are of 2 types :
  1. Primary ( 4 partition possible)
  2. Logical
* OS is installed in Primary partition
* Stores data fast, secure, easy to access in primary partition
* other then primary partition , we can make extended partition
* extended partition does not store data but inside it we can creates logical partition (60 possible) which stores information.
* total partitions present = primary + logical in reality but it shows total partitions = primary + extended + Logical
* Only single extended partition possible with 3 primary partitions
* without extended , we can make 4 primary partitions.
* maximum 2TB hard-disk size

GPT

* GUID Partition table
* Globally Unique Identifier
* No logic regarding extended partitions
* 128 primary partitions are possible

UMASK

    it defines the allotment of permissions to newly created files in linux.
    to find current permissions to be given to file calculate umask value by 0777 - umask around
    check with file system permissions numbering
    other user has umask = 0002(default)
    root user has umask = 0022 (default)

Primary Partition

    An operating system needs primary partition for its installation.
    We can make maximum 4 primary partitions in MBR.

Logical Partition

    There are under Extended partition.
    In an extened partition we have 60 Logical partition.

Python Class

impory sys
x= sys.argv[1:]
sum = 0
for i in x:
    sum = sum + int(i)
print(sum)

$python sum.py 1 5351 8453 465 3554 454 3
354015

TASK

    open 4 ~ 5 processes and save data of RAM to hard-disk and after reboot re-transfer data from hard-disk to RAM
    create a file that contains number of email ids,send a common email message to all emails and verify the email address as well
    find number of devices connected from your hotspot using python
    WAP to list number of users present in linux based OS
    take 10 commands randomly from a user and check if it is present then run it other wise give voice based error message
    make tree directory architecture and provide different permissions

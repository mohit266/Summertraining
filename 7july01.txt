# DAY 32

## Notes :
  * Libraries to use mathematical functions are
    * Numpy ( mathematical problems )
    * Theano ( advance mathematical problems )
  * Work of a data scientist is to clean the data in a proper format as per the requirement
  * learn to create a template to use libraries without importing modules
  * Learning Path to revise the data science
    1. don't go deep into mathematics instead learn to use predefined variables,parameters and outputs
    2. Start with Data Processing( minimum 21 hours ) , focus on its 3 functionalities :
      * Label Encoder
      * One hot encoder
      * Feature Scaling
      * Imputing
    3. Second to work with is Supervised Machine Learning (minimum 4 algorithms), with 4 examples of each  ( around 30 hours )
    4. Third division to work upon is Computer Vision( minimum 80 Hours ) and it can be integrated with IOT
    5. Learn to clean and improve data and be able to integrate with any program
    6. After all above you could be able to shift to NLP ( minimum 20 hour ) -> cleaning data , making chat box
    7. Move to Deep Learning and start with Tensorflow then Keras followed by Pytorch ( minimum 6 Months )

# Neural Networks
  * Real brain of a human can be referred as Neural Network and A network made by human with the use of neurals is ANN that is Artificial Neural Network
  * Advance version of Tensorflow is Keras
  * Keras is more automated way of Tensorflow
  * Forward Propagation - > moving from input layer to output layer
  * Back Propagation - > moving from output layer to input layer when value of actual cost is not proper
  * Weight Adjustment is done by Gradient Descent
  * It is of 2 types
    * Batch Gradient Descent -> works on brute force
    * Stochastic Gradient Descent ->
  * Epoch - > complete training of a dataset in a neural network  
## ANN
  * data is provided to Network in layer called input layer
  * activation function processes on each hidden layer for output and pass the value to next layer
  * It has no need for GPU

## CNN
  * Each neuron on a hidden layer must be connected to each neuron of next hidden layer
  * Advance version of opencv
  * GPU is a major requirement

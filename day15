##Machine Learning | Data Science

    Data Science is distinguished in two forms
        Big Data
        Machine Learning
    Big Data is a field where we store and manage huge amounts of data for storage and its processing.
    Machine Learning is applying mathematical calculations or processing the data generated by big Data platforms use them and extract useful information form it.
    Deep learning is a technology which is used to solve complex problems which Machine Learning cannot solve or handle.
    Its more over your custom designed Machine Learning model.

#NumPy Numerical Python

    Tensorflow is the advanced version of NumPy.
    The data would be atleast in two dimensions and can be in 100's of Dimensions.
    To install numpy we use

#pip install numpy

    To use numpy we import it with a name to short the module name

#import numpy as np

    We can create array in numpy by calling a function only.

   a = np.array([1,2,45,35,45])

 * We can print an array just by using the variable name or we can print a specific value also.

print(a)
print(a[0])
  [ 2  7  1 99  4]
  2

 * We can also perform operations on arrays

  a*2
  a**2
  a+b

 * We can create multidimensional arrays just by adding list brackets inside the list.
 
  x = np.array([[2,5,8],[3,6,1]])
  [[2 5 8]
  [3 6 1]]

 *  Now we have a full table and now we can access it by using matrix row x column
    When we use x+7 it basically adds 7 in every element of the array.
    If I want a specific row just use the 1st row index in array.

   x[0]
   [2 5 8]

  * We can get the shape size or matrix dimensions by calling the shape() function with the matrix variable.

x.shape()

  * To get specific number of rows we use slicing tool

  z[0:5]
